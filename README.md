We welcome contributions from everyone. Here's how to contribute:

### Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**: Get the latest version of the project:

    ```sh
    git clone -b develop https://github.com/TheCreators/RadiantBloom-BeyondHorizon
    cd RadiantBloom-BeyondHorizon
    ```

### Making Changes

1. **Create a New Branch**: Start by creating a new branch from `develop`:
    
    ```sh
    git checkout develop
    git pull origin develop  # Ensure you're up-to-date
    git checkout -b my-new-branch
    ```

    Replace `my-new-branch` with a descriptive name for your branch.

2. **Make Your Changes**: Implement your feature or fix, adhering to the project's code style and conventions.

3. **Test Your Changes**: Before committing, test your changes locally to ensure everything works as expected.

4. **Commit and Push**: Commit your changes with clear, descriptive messages. Then, push them to your fork:

    ```sh
    git push -u origin my-new-branch
    ```

### Proposing Changes

1. **Submit a Pull Request (PR)**: Go to GitHub and create a PR against the `develop` branch of the main repository. Clearly describe your changes and their impact.

2. **Participate in Code Review**: Engage with any feedback during the review process. This collaboration ensures high-quality contributions.

### Best Practices

- **Keep Your Fork Updated**: Regularly sync your fork's develop branch with the main repository to avoid merge conflicts.

- **Communicate Clearly**: Use clear, respectful language in your PRs and comments to facilitate collaboration.

By following these guidelines, you'll help ensure that your contributions are integrated smoothly and efficiently. Happy coding!
